We set the scene by saying that the world is under pressure, to both look after the quality of human lives as well as the planet that we live on.  We fully subscribe to the new and innovative thinking that is emerging around the globe towards a more sustainable way of quality life for all of us.

To ensure that happens, in line with the 7 ways to think like a 21st Century Economist, we believe in the importance of the state, the essential nature of business and a healthy market and in particular the value of the commons.

Therefore we want to foster an open digital commons in healthcare. To do so we believe that a blend of both open source and open standards are needed. There are a wide variety of related resources available all over the internet, yet nothing that pulls the key elements together to try to foster a related global community.

See the principles behind our open platform push here.

See the value of open source nicely explained here.

We wish to foster a showcase of highly usable, easy to integrate, vendor and technology neutral open platform in healthcare. While we are aware of open source efforts that suffer from a lack of standards, we are also aware of a load of open standards work  
 
Here is our expose of the state of the health commons
